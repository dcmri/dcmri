Funding
*******

Development of ``dcmri`` was funded by the European Union's Innovative 
Health Initiative as part of the 
`TRISTAN project <https://www.ihi.europa.eu/projects-results/project-factsheets/tristan>`_ 

TRISTAN is a public-private partnership aiming to validate imaging biomarkers 
for drug safety assessment. TRISTAN applies DCMRI methods to assess 
liver-mediated drug-drug interactions (DDI) and drug-induced toxicity in liver 
(DILI) and lung (DIILD). A 
`DCMRI biomarker for DDI <https://www.fda.gov/media/149415/download>`_ based 
on an implementation in ``dcmri`` has been accepted by the US food and drug 
administration (FDA) in their formal 
`biomarker qualification program <https://www.fda.gov/media/149413/download>`_. 

See the `website <https://www.imi-tristan.eu/>`_ of the TRISTAN project for 
more information.
