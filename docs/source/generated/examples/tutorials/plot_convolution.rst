=====================================
A comparison of convolution functions
=====================================

Convolution is a key operation in any application of pharmacokinetic 
analysis. The reason for this central role is that the solution of a linear 
and stationary system can always be written as a convolution. `dcmri` includes 
functions that 
perform convolution in the most general context, but also includes solutions 
that are optimized for common special cases. 

This tutorial illustrates the use of these functions and compares their 
performance against other implementations.

Convolving any two functions
----------------------------
There are different definitions possible for the convolution product, and 
they are not necessarily interchangeable. We illustrate this here by 
convolving two functions with `~dcmri.conv` and comparing the result to 
a naive application of `numpy.convolve`. For the purposes of this 
illustration we will convolve normalized gaussian distributions f(t) and 
h(t):

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 39-58

.. code-block:: Python


    # Generate some gaussian data
    t = np.linspace(0, 100, 50)
    f = norm.pdf(t, 30, 5)
    h = norm.pdf(t, 60, 10)

    # Convolve them in two different ways:
    g = dc.conv(h, f, t)
    g1 = np.convolve(h, f, mode='same')

    # Show the data and their convolutions
    plt.plot(t, f, 'r-', label='f(t)')
    plt.plot(t, h, 'b-', label='h(t)')
    plt.plot(t, g, 'k-', label='dcmri.conv')

While there is clearly some relation between both results, they are not in 
any way similar. The `~numpy.convolve` result is shifted compared to 
`~dcmri.conv` and has a lower amplitude. This shows that caution is needed 
when applying convolution formulae from different libraries in a 
tracer-kinetic setting.

Convolution with an exponential
-------------------------------
The generic function `~dcmri.conv` applies to any two functions, but is 
uneccesarily slow in special cases where the functional form of the 
factors is known. An example is the case where one of the 
factors is an exponential function - a very common scenario in 
pharmacokinetics. In that case the function `~dcmri.expconv` can be used: 

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 74-92

.. code-block:: Python


    # Convolve the Gaussian with an exponential explicitly:
    Tf = 20
    f = np.exp(-t/Tf)/Tf
    g0 = dc.conv(h, f, t)

    # Now convolve the same data again using the expconv function:
    g1 = dc.expconv(h, Tf, t)

    # Compare the two results on the same plot:
    plt.plot(t, f, 'r-', label='f(t)')
    plt.plot(t, h, 'b-', label='h(t)')
    plt.plot(t, g0, label='conv()', linewidth=6, color='lightgray', linestyle='-')
    plt.plot(t, g1, 'k-', label='expconv()')
    plt.title('Comparison of conv() and expconv()')

The result shows that the difference in accuracy between `~dcmri.expconv` 
and `~dcmri.conv` is negligible at higher time resolution. 
However, `~dcmri.expconv` comes with a major improvement in computation 
time. We illustrate the effect by 
applying the functions 500 times and measuring the total computation time 
in each case:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 99-112

.. code-block:: Python


    # Print the duration of 500 runs of conv:
    start = time.time()
    for _ in range(500):
        dc.conv(h, f, t)
    print('Computation time for conv(): ', time.time()-start, 'sec')

    # Print the duration of 500 runs of expconv:
    start = time.time()
    for _ in range(500):
        dc.expconv(h, Tf, t)
    print('Computation time for expconv(): ', time.time()-start, 'sec')

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 113-117

The acceleration is 2 orders of magnitude. Incidentally since the 
time array in this case is uniform, `~dcmri.conv` 
can be accelerated by specifying dt instead of t in the arguments. However 
the performance remains far below `~dcmri.expconv`:

    # Print the duration of 500 runs of conv with uniform dt:
    start = time.time()
    for i in range(500):

    print('Computation time for conv(): ', 
          time.time()-start, 'sec')

The difference in accuracy between `~dcmri.conv` and `~dcmri.expconv` 
becomes more apparent at lower temporal resolution but generally remains 
minor. Using 10 time points instead of 50 as above we start seeing some 
effect:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 130-149

.. code-block:: Python


    # Generate Gaussian and exponential at low temporal resolution:
    t = np.linspace(0, 120, 10)
    h = norm.pdf(t, 60, 10)
    f = np.exp(-t/Tf)/Tf

    # Convolve the Gaussian with the exponential in two different ways:
    g0 = dc.conv(h, f, t)
    g1 = dc.expconv(h, Tf, t)

    # Compare the result on the same plot:

    plt.plot(t, h, 'b-', label='h(t)')

Convolving two or more exponentials
-----------------------------------
If both functions are exponentials, convolution can be accelerated further 
with `~dcmri.biexpconv`, which uses an analytical formula to calculate the 
convolution: 

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 155-172

.. code-block:: Python


    # Create and exponential dataset:
    Th = 10
    h = np.exp(-t/Th)/Th

    # Print the duration of 1000 runs of expconv:
    start = time.time()
    for i in range(1000):
        dc.expconv(h, Tf, t)
    print('Computation time for expconv(): ', time.time()-start, 'sec')

    # Print the duration of 1000 runs of biexpconv:
    start = time.time()
    for i in range(1000):
        dc.biexpconv(Th, Tf, t)
    print('Computation time for biexpconv(): ', time.time()-start, 'sec')

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 173-176

The difference in computation time is small in this case, but using an 
analytical formula also comes with some improvements in accuracy. This is 
apparent at lower time resolution:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 176-192

.. code-block:: Python


    # Compute a bioexponential convolution with expconv:
    g0 = dc.expconv(h, Tf, t)

    # Compare the results on the same plot:

The final convolution function `~dcmri.nexpconv` convolves n indentical 
exponentials with mean transit time T analytically. We illustrate the 
result by keeping the total mean transit time MTT=nT constant, and 
increasing n from 1 to 100. As the number of exponentials increases, the 
convolution converges to a delta function positioned on t=MTT:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 198-215

.. code-block:: Python


    # Convolve 1, 10 and 100 indentical exponentials with the same total MTT:
    MTT = 30
    t = np.linspace(0, 120, 500)
    g1 = dc.nexpconv(1, MTT/1, t)
    g10 = dc.nexpconv(10, MTT/10, t)
    g100 = dc.nexpconv(100, MTT/100, t)

    # Compare the results on the same plot
    plt.plot(t, g1, 'r-', label='1 exponential')
    plt.plot(t, g10, 'g-', label='10 exponentials')

Convolution with a step function
--------------------------------
`dcmri` also provides a dedicated function `~dcmri.stepconv` for 
convolution with a step function. We illustrate this function here and 
compare against `~dcmri.conv`:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 221-248

.. code-block:: Python


    # Generate some Gaussian data:
    n = 15
    t = np.linspace(0, 120, n)
    f = norm.pdf(t, 30, 10)
    T, D = 45, 0.5

    # Construct a step function explicitly:
    T0, T1 = T-D*T, T+D*T
    h = np.zeros(n)
    h[(t>=T0)*(t<=T1)] = 1/(T1-T0)

    # Convolve the step function with the Gaussian using conv:
    g0 = dc.conv(h, f, t)

    # Convolve the step function with the Gaussian using stepconv:
    g1 = dc.stepconv(f, T, D, t)

    # Compare the results on the same plot:

As with `~dcmri.expconv` the difference between `~dcmri.stepconv` and 
`~dcmri.conv` is relatively small even for coarse time grids such as the 
above, but there is a more substantial gain in computation time:
