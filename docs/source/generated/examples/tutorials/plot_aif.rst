====================================
The role of Arterial Input Functions
====================================

This tutorial will explore the role of the arterial input function (AIF) in 
DC-MRI analysis, including the effect of using population-average AIFs versus 
subject-specific AIFs.

Why do we measure AIFs?
-----------------------
We simulate a DCE-MRI experiment on the brain of two subjects (A and B) 
that are identical, except that A has a higher cardiac output (9 litres per 
minute or 150 mL/sec) than B (6 litres per minute or 100 mL/sec). Let's 
simulate the signal-time curves that we would measure in grey matter. 

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 24-57

.. code-block:: Python


    # Define the experimental setup
    tmax = 120      # Maximum acquisition time is 120 seconds (first-pass perfusion imaging)
    dt = 1.5        # Temporal resolution is 1.5 seconds
    t = np.arange(0, tmax, dt)

    # Define the tissue properties
    tissue = {
        'kinetics': 'NX',   # NX = No-Exchange of contrast agent is appropriate 
                            # for brain tissue with intact blood-brain barrier.
        'vb': 0.05,         # Blood volume fraction is 5 mL/100mL in grey matter, 
                            # or 0.05 in standard units of mL/mL.
        'Fb': 0.01,         # Blood flow is 60 mL/min/100mL in grey matter, 
                            # or 0.01 in standard units of mL/sec/mL.
    }

    # Simulate the concentrations at the arterial inlet to the tissue. 
    # We use `aif_tristan` here as this allows us to modify the cardiac output:
    ca_A = dc.aif_tristan(t, BAT=20, CO=150)
    ca_B = dc.aif_tristan(t, BAT=20, CO=100)

    # Generate tissue signals
    sig_A = dc.Tissue(ca=ca_A, t=t, **tissue).signal()
    sig_B = dc.Tissue(ca=ca_B, t=t, **tissue).signal()

    # Compare the two signals:
    plt.plot(t, sig_A, 'r-', label='Grey matter (subject A)')
    plt.plot(t, sig_B, 'b-', label='Grey matter (subject B)')
    plt.xlabel('Time (sec)')

The signals are very different, even though the grey matter of A and B is 
identical. The difference reflects the cardiac output, which is a confounder 
in an experiment that aims to characterise the brain tissue. 

Any visual interpretation of the signal-time curves, or a descriptive 
analysis using parameters such as the area under the signal-enhancement 
curve, or maximum signal enhancement, would lead to the false conclusion 
that the grey matter of subject B is more perfused than that of subject A. 
The AIF avoids this pitfall, and ensures that any systemic differences 
between subjects are not misinterpreted as differences in tissue properties.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 70-80

How is the AIF used?
--------------------
To illustrate how this works, let's treat the signals generated above as 
measurements and use them to determine the unknown perfusion and 
vascularity of the grey matter of subjects A and B. 

We create the tissue models again, but since the tissue properties are 
now unknown, we do not provide the values of `vb` and `Fb`. 
We assume the arterial concentrations are known from a separate measurement, 
so these are provided as arterial input concentration to the model:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 80-91

.. code-block:: Python


    A = dc.Tissue(ca=ca_A, t=t, kinetics='NX')
    B = dc.Tissue(ca=ca_B, t=t, kinetics='NX')

    # At this stage the tissue parameters are set to default values that 
    # are incorrect:
    print('Tissue parameters: ')
    print(A.params('vb', 'Fb'))
    print('Ground truth:')
    print([tissue['vb'], tissue['Fb']])





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Tissue parameters: 
    [0.1, 0.02]
    Ground truth:
    [0.05, 0.01]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 92-94

Now we adjust those parameters by training the models using the measured 
signals:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 94-103

.. code-block:: Python


    A.train(t, sig_A)
    B.train(t, sig_B) 

    print('Tissue parameters (subject A): ')
    print(A.params('vb', 'Fb', round_to=3))
    print('Tissue parameters (subject B): ')
    print(B.params('vb', 'Fb', round_to=3))

    Tissue parameters (subject A): 
    [np.float64(0.05), np.float64(0.01)]
    Tissue parameters (subject B): 
    [np.float64(0.05), np.float64(0.01)]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 104-108

Thanks to the AIF, we correctly conclude 
from these data that the blood flow and the blood volume of the grey matter 
of A and B are the same, despite the very different appearance of the 
signals measured in the grey matter of both subjects. 

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 110-126

The case for population AIFs
----------------------------
The difficulty with the approach outlined above is that this requires an 
(accurate) measurement of the arterial concentration or signal in 
individual subjects. This is not a trivial problem. Feeding arteries are 
small for instance, in which case a concentration in pure blood may not be 
accessible; or they are far from the tissue of interest, causing bolus 
dispersion errors or differences in signal properties that are difficult to 
correct for; or they are measured in rapidly flowing and pulsating blood 
where standard signal models may be inaccurate. 

If the arterial input is inaccurately measured, then the input to the 
tissue is misinterpreted, and this will translate to an error in the 
measured parameters. To illustrate this, let's assume there is a partial 
volume error in the AIF of patient A, causing its arterial blood 
concentration to be underestimated by a factor 2:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 126-138

.. code-block:: Python


    A = dc.Tissue(ca=ca_A/2, t=t, kinetics='NX')

    # Now let's train the model again :
    A.train(t, sig_A)

    # And check the impact on the measured parameters:
    print('Tissue parameters (subject A): ')
    print(A.params('vb', 'Fb', round_to=3))
    print('Ground truth:')
    print([tissue['vb'], tissue['Fb']])





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Tissue parameters (subject A): 
    [np.float64(0.1), np.float64(0.02)]
    Ground truth:
    [0.05, 0.01]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 139-159

The tissue perfusion is now overestimated with the same factor 2, which 
obviously could lead to entirely wrong conclusions as regards the grey 
matter health. An additional problem is that this type of error is 
difficult to control. If partial volume effects are present, they will 
cause different levels of overestimation in different measurements. So this 
not only causes a bias, but also a variability that will impact even on 
assessed changes over time in the same subject. 

Addressing those issues by experimental design may be possible to some 
extent, but may also require changes that are incompatible with other 
constraints. For instance, partial volume errors can be reduced by 
increasing the image resolution, but this may lead to acquisition times 
that are too long for blood flow measurement. 

An alternative approach that is sometimes proposed is to avoid the use of a 
measured AIF alltogether, and instead use a standardized AIF measured once 
using a similar experiment on a representative population. 
A popular choice is the AIF derived by 
`Parker et al (2006) <https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mrm.21066>`_, 
which is implemented in ``dcmri`` as the function `~dcmri.aif_parker`.

Example using a population AIF
------------------------------
To illustrate the implications of using a population-based AIF, lets 
analyse the data from our subjects A and B again, this time using a 
popular population-based AIF:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 166-188

.. code-block:: Python


    ca_pop = dc.aif_parker(t, BAT=20)

    A = dc.Tissue(ca=ca_pop, t=t, kinetics='NX')
    B = dc.Tissue(ca=ca_pop, t=t, kinetics='NX')

    # Train the models using the measured signals for each subject:
    A.train(t, sig_A)
    B.train(t, sig_B)

    # Check the fits:
    A.plot(t, sig_A)
    B.plot(t, sig_B)

    # Check the values for the measured parameters:
    print('Tissue parameters (subject A): ')
    print(A.params('vb', 'Fb', round_to=4))
    print('Tissue parameters (subject B): ')
    print(B.params('vb', 'Fb', round_to=4))
    print('Ground truth:')
    print([tissue['vb'], tissue['Fb']])

    Ground truth:
    [0.05, 0.01]




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 189-203

The fit to the data is good and the measurements of ``vb`` are not so far 
off the ground truth (0.05): underestimated for subject A (0.04)
and overestimated for subject B (0.06). The estimates 
for the blood flow values are a factor 2.8 and 1.8 underestimated, 
respectively. Apart from thse biases, the analysis also leads to the (false) 
conclusion that the cerebral blood volume and -flow values of B are 50% 
higher than A. 

Hence, while a suitable chosen population AIF may produce values in the 
correct order of magnitude, it suffers from the same fundamental problem as 
descriptive or qualitative curve-type analyses that between subject 
differences in tissue curves are interpreted as reflecting tissue 
properties, even if in reality they are due to systemic differences 
(cardiac output in this example).

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 205-215

Choice of a population AIF
--------------------------
The comparative accuracy of the absolute values reflects the fact that the 
experimental conditions under which the population-average AIF from Parker 
et al was derived are actually very similar to this example (standard dose 
and injection rate of a standard extracellular agent). 

Plotting the population AIF against that of our subjects A and B shows that 
they are indeed in the same range of concentrations:

.. code-block:: Python

    plt.plot(t, ca_A, 'r-', label='Arterial concentration (subject A)')
    plt.plot(t, ca_B, 'b-', label='Arterial concentration (subject B)')
    plt.plot(t, ca_pop, 'g-', label='Arterial concentration (population-average)')
    plt.xlabel('Time (sec)')
    plt.ylabel('Signal (a.u.)')
    plt.legend()
    plt.show()

   :class: sphx-glr-single-img





.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 224-227

We can investigate this more quantitatively by fitting the population AIF 
to an aorta model. Since the `Aorta` model predicts signals rather than 
concentrations, we need to first convert the concentrations to signals:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 227-234

.. code-block:: Python


    cb = (1-0.45)*ca_pop                        # Convert to blood concentration using standard Hct
    R10 = 1/dc.T1(3.0, 'blood')                 # Precontrast R1 for blood at 3T
    r1 = dc.relaxivity(agent='gadodiamide')     # Relaxivity of the agent
    R1 = R10 + r1*cb                            # Relaxation rate as a function of time
    sig_pop = dc.signal_ss(R1, 1, 0.005, 15)    # Signal as a function of time








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 235-241

Now we can train the Aorta model, setting the experimental parameters to 
match the conditions of the original paper (Parker et al 2005). We use a 
chain model for the heart-lung system, which is relatively slow but 
provides a better fit to high-resolution first pass data than the default 
'pfcomp'. The defaults for the other constants (field strength, flip angle 
etc) are correct so do not need to be provided explicitly:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 241-255

.. code-block:: Python


    aorta = dc.Aorta(
        rate = 3, 
        agent = 'gadodiamide', 
        dose = 0.2, 
        heartlung = 'chain',
    )

    # Train the model using the population AIF. 
    aorta.train(t, sig_pop, xtol=1e-3)

    # We can check that the trained model provides a good fit to the data:
    aorta.plot(t, sig_pop)

The cardiac output of the populaton AIF is 162 mL/sec, higher than 
the values for either subject A or B. This is consistent with the systematic 
underestimation in the blood flow values observed.
