This is not a trivial problem. Feeding arteries are \nsmall for instance, in which case a concentration in pure blood may not be \naccessible; or they are far from the tissue of interest, causing bolus \ndispersion errors or differences in signal properties that are difficult to \ncorrect for; or they are measured in rapidly flowing and pulsating blood \nwhere standard signal models may be inaccurate. \n\nIf the arterial input is inaccurately measured, then the input to the \ntissue is misinterpreted, and this will translate to an error in the \nmeasured parameters. To illustrate this, let's assume there is a partial \nvolume error in the AIF of patient A, causing its arterial blood \nconcentration to be underestimated by a factor 2:\n\n"

An additional problem is that this type of error is \ndifficult to control. If partial volume effects are present, they will \ncause different levels of overestimation in different measurements. So this \nnot only causes a bias, but also a variability that will impact even on \nassessed changes over time in the same subject. \n\nAddressing those issues by experimental design may be possible to some \nextent, but may also require changes that are incompatible with other \nconstraints. For instance, partial volume errors can be reduced by \nincreasing the image resolution, but this may lead to acquisition times \nthat are too long for blood flow measurement. \n\nAn alternative approach that is sometimes proposed is to avoid the use of a \nmeasured AIF alltogether, and instead use a standardized AIF measured once \nusing a similar experiment on a representative population. \nA popular choice is the AIF derived by \n[Parker et al (2006)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mrm.21066), \nwhich is implemented in ``dcmri`` as the function `~dcmri.aif_parker`.\n\n"
