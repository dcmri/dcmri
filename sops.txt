Creating a new release
----------------------

- Check test coverage is 100% (see below)
- Update the version number in the following locations and push to dev.
    - pyproject.toml
    - __init__.py
    - docs/conf.py
    - tests/test_dcmri.py
- Create a release on github
- Build release notes (see below) and push changes to dev
- Merge the dev branch with the main branch.
- Create a release on PyPI (see below)

Check test coverage
-------------------

cd to /dcmri top folder
>>> pytest --cov=dcmri --cov-report term-missing


Creating a PyPi release
-----------------------

In the terminal, cd to the /dcmri directory, and:

>>> python -m build
>>> twine upload dist/*

When prompted for user name, enter __token__

As password paste the API token generated in PyPi (repository settings). Note: Paste with Ctrl-V does not work in Windows. Use Edit > Paste via the menu.


Build release notes
-------------------
- Get a personal token on https://github.com/settings/tokens (does not need any permissions)
- Save the token in the environment variable GH_TOKEN. On windows:
>>> $env:GH_TOKEN='token'
- Build the changelog from current version to current dev. For instance:
>>> changelist QIB-Sheffield/dcmri 0.2.0 dev –-format rst
- Copy-paste the terminal output in an .rst file and save it in docs/source/releases
- Add an entry in the index of docs/source/releases


Changing dependencies
---------------------

- update requirements.txt
- update pyproject.toml
- generate a new poetry.lock file. On the terminal, run
>>> poetry lock
