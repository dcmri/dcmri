A comparison of convolution functions
=====================================

Convolution is a key operation in any application of pharmacokinetic 
analysis. The reason for this central role is that the solution of a linear 
and stationary system can always be written as a convolution. `dcmri` includes 
functions that 
perform convolution in the most general context, but also includes solutions 
that are optimized for common special cases. 

This tutorial illustrates the use of these functions and compares their 
performance against other implementations.

# %%
# Convolving any two functions
# ----------------------------
# There are different definitions possible for the convolution product, and 
# they are not necessarily interchangeable. We illustrate this here by 
# convolving two functions with `~dcmri.conv` and comparing the result to 
# a naive application of `numpy.convolve`. For the purposes of this 
# illustration we will convolve normalized gaussian distributions f(t) and 
# h(t):

# Generate some gaussian data
t = np.linspace(0, 100, 50)
f = norm.pdf(t, 30, 5)
h = norm.pdf(t, 60, 10)

# Convolve them in two different ways:
g = dc.conv(h, f, t)
g1 = np.convolve(h, f, mode='same')

# Show the data and their convolutions
plt.plot(t, f, 'r-', label='f(t)')
plt.plot(t, h, 'b-', label='h(t)')
plt.plot(t, g, 'k-', label='dcmri.conv')
plt.plot(g1, 'k:', label='numpy.convolve')
plt.title('Convolution of two gaussian distributions')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# %%
# While there is clearly some relation between both results, they are not in 
# any way similar. The `~numpy.convolve` result is shifted compared to 
# `~dcmri.conv` and has a lower amplitude. This shows that caution is needed 
# when applying convolution formulae from different libraries in a 
# tracer-kinetic setting.


# %%
# Convolution with an exponential
# -------------------------------
# The generic function `~dcmri.conv` applies to any two functions, but is 
# uneccesarily slow in special cases where the functional form of the 
# factors is known. An example is the case where one of the 
# factors is an exponential function - a very common scenario in 
# pharmacokinetics. In that case the function `~dcmri.expconv` can be used: 

# Convolve the Gaussian with an exponential explicitly:
Tf = 20
f = np.exp(-t/Tf)/Tf
g0 = dc.conv(h, f, t)

# Now convolve the same data again using the expconv function:
g1 = dc.expconv(h, Tf, t)

# Compare the two results on the same plot:
plt.plot(t, f, 'r-', label='f(t)')
plt.plot(t, h, 'b-', label='h(t)')
plt.plot(t, g0, label='conv()', linewidth=6, color='lightgray', linestyle='-')
plt.plot(t, g1, 'k-', label='expconv()')
plt.title('Comparison of conv() and expconv()')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# %%
# The result shows that the difference in accuracy between `~dcmri.expconv` 
# and `~dcmri.conv` is negligible at higher time resolution. 
# However, `~dcmri.expconv` comes with a major improvement in computation 
# time. We illustrate the effect by 
# applying the functions 500 times and measuring the total computation time 
# in each case:

# Print the duration of 500 runs of conv:
start = time.time()
for _ in range(500):
    dc.conv(h, f, t)
print('Computation time for conv(): ', time.time()-start, 'sec')

# Print the duration of 500 runs of expconv:
start = time.time()
for _ in range(500):
    dc.expconv(h, Tf, t)
print('Computation time for expconv(): ', time.time()-start, 'sec')

# %%
# The acceleration is 2 orders of magnitude. Incidentally since the 
# time array in this case is uniform, `~dcmri.conv` 
# can be accelerated by specifying dt instead of t in the arguments. However 
# the performance remains far below `~dcmri.expconv`:

# Print the duration of 500 runs of conv with uniform dt:
start = time.time()
for i in range(500):
    dc.conv(h, f, dt=t[1])
print('Computation time for conv(): ', 
      time.time()-start, 'sec')

# %%
# The difference in accuracy between `~dcmri.conv` and `~dcmri.expconv` 
# becomes more apparent at lower temporal resolution but generally remains 
# minor. Using 10 time points instead of 50 as above we start seeing some 
# effect:

# Generate Gaussian and exponential at low temporal resolution:
t = np.linspace(0, 120, 10)
h = norm.pdf(t, 60, 10)
f = np.exp(-t/Tf)/Tf

# Convolve the Gaussian with the exponential in two different ways:
g0 = dc.conv(h, f, t)
g1 = dc.expconv(h, Tf, t)

# Compare the result on the same plot:
plt.plot(t, f, 'r-', label='f(t)')
plt.plot(t, h, 'b-', label='h(t)')
plt.plot(t, g0, label='conv()', linewidth=6, color='lightgray', linestyle='-')
plt.plot(t, g1, 'k-', label='expconv()')
plt.title('Comparison of conv() and expconv() at lower resolution')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# %%
# Convolving two or more exponentials
# -----------------------------------
# If both functions are exponentials, convolution can be accelerated further 
# with `~dcmri.biexpconv`, which uses an analytical formula to calculate the 
# convolution: 

# Create and exponential dataset:
Th = 10
h = np.exp(-t/Th)/Th

# Print the duration of 1000 runs of expconv:
start = time.time()
for i in range(1000):
    dc.expconv(h, Tf, t)
print('Computation time for expconv(): ', time.time()-start, 'sec')

# Print the duration of 1000 runs of biexpconv:
start = time.time()
for i in range(1000):
    dc.biexpconv(Th, Tf, t)
print('Computation time for biexpconv(): ', time.time()-start, 'sec')

# %%
# The difference in computation time is small in this case, but using an 
# analytical formula also comes with some improvements in accuracy. This is 
# apparent at lower time resolution:

# Compute a bioexponential convolution with expconv:
g0 = dc.expconv(h, Tf, t)

# Compute a biexponential convolution with biexpconv:
g1 = dc.biexpconv(Th, Tf, t)

# Compare the results on the same plot:
plt.plot(t, f, 'r-', label='f(t)')
plt.plot(t, h, 'b-', label='h(t)')
plt.plot(t, g0, 'k-', label='expconv()')
plt.plot(t, g1, color='gray', linestyle='-', label='biexpconv()')
plt.title('Comparison of expconv() and biexpconv()')
plt.legend()
plt.show()

# %%
# The final convolution function `~dcmri.nexpconv` convolves n indentical 
# exponentials with mean transit time T analytically. We illustrate the 
# result by keeping the total mean transit time MTT=nT constant, and 
# increasing n from 1 to 100. As the number of exponentials increases, the 
# convolution converges to a delta function positioned on t=MTT:

# Convolve 1, 10 and 100 indentical exponentials with the same total MTT:
MTT = 30
t = np.linspace(0, 120, 500)
g1 = dc.nexpconv(1, MTT/1, t)
g10 = dc.nexpconv(10, MTT/10, t)
g100 = dc.nexpconv(100, MTT/100, t)

# Compare the results on the same plot
plt.plot(t, g1, 'r-', label='1 exponential')
plt.plot(t, g10, 'g-', label='10 exponentials')
plt.plot(t, g100, 'b-', label='100 exponentials')
plt.title('Convolutions of identical exponentials')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
 

# %%
# Convolution with a step function
# --------------------------------
# `dcmri` also provides a dedicated function `~dcmri.stepconv` for 
# convolution with a step function. We illustrate this function here and 
# compare against `~dcmri.conv`:

# Generate some Gaussian data:
n = 15
t = np.linspace(0, 120, n)
f = norm.pdf(t, 30, 10)
T, D = 45, 0.5

# Construct a step function explicitly:
T0, T1 = T-D*T, T+D*T
h = np.zeros(n)
h[(t>=T0)*(t<=T1)] = 1/(T1-T0)

# Convolve the step function with the Gaussian using conv:
g0 = dc.conv(h, f, t)

# Convolve the step function with the Gaussian using stepconv:
g1 = dc.stepconv(f, T, D, t)

# Compare the results on the same plot:
plt.plot(t, f, 'r-', label='f(t)')
plt.plot(t, g0, 'k-', label='conv()')
plt.plot(t, g1, color='gray', linestyle='-', label='stepconv()')
plt.title('Comparison of conv() and stepconv()')
plt.legend()
plt.show()


# %%
# As with `~dcmri.expconv` the difference between `~dcmri.stepconv` and 
# `~dcmri.conv` is relatively small even for coarse time grids such as the 
# above, but there is a more substantial gain in computation time: 

# Print the computation time for 500 runs of conv:
start = time.time()
for _ in range(500):
    dc.conv(h, f, t)
print('Computation time for conv(): ', time.time()-start, 'sec')

# Print the computation time for 500 runs of stepconv:
start = time.time()
for _ in range(500):
    dc.stepconv(f, T, D, t)
print('Computation time for stepconv(): ', time.time()-start, 'sec')
