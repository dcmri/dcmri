        "\n# Dealing with inflow effects\n\n[Nichlas Vous Christensen](https://www.au.dk/en/nvc@clin.au.dk), \n[Mohsen Redda](https://www.au.dk/en/au569527@biomed.au.dk), \n[Steven Sourbron](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/smph/people/academic/clinical-medicine/steven-sourbron).\n\n## What are inflow effects?\nInflow effects in the arterial input function (AIF) are a common \ntype of artefact in DCE-MRI which severely biases the results if it \nis not properly acccounted for. The effect is caused by unsaturated \nblood flowing into the imaging slab causing an artefactual increase \nof the baseline signal. A naive analysis of inflow-corrupted data \nunderestimates the arterial concentration and consequently \noverestimates tissue perfusion parameters. \n\nInflow effects can be detected visually by \ninspecting a precontrast image. Since blood has a long T1, arteries \nshould be dark on a T1-weighted image. If they are instead \nbrighter than surrounding tissue, this is evidence of inflow effects. \nThe brightness typically shows a gradient with the vessel being \nbrightest at the edge of the slab where flow-induced enhancement is \nmost severe, then gradually darking as the blood travels down the slab \nand is pushed into steady-state by the excitation pulses. \n\n## Minimizing inflow effects\nThe most robust approach to dealing with inflow effects is by \neliminating them at the source, by optimizing the acquisition. In \nabdominal imaging this can often be achieved by positioning the slab \ncoronally and extending the field of view to include the heart. \n\nThis may not always be possible though, for instance for prostate imaging \nwhere the heart is too far from the region of interest. Even when it \nis technically possible, such as for liver or renal imaging, it may \nrequire compromises in other areas: the approach forbids axial \nimaging, which is sometimes preferred, and may also come at a cost of \nspatial resolution. \n\nOther approaches may be possible, such as \nincreasing the flip angle to accelerate transition to steady-state; \nbut this comes with other compromises such as increased tissue \nheating and reduced signal enhancement.\n\n## Correcting inflow effects\nIf inflow effects cannot be fully avoided by optimizing the \nacquisition, or data with inflow effects are analysed retrospectively, \nthe problem must be addressed at image analysis stage. \n\nOne approach \nthat has sometimes been applied is to measure the input function \ndeeper down in the slab where inflow effects have largely decayed. \nThis is not always feasible and may cause variability in result for \ninstance due to differences in blood velocity.\n\nThis tutorial illustrates two alternative approaches: using a \nstandardised input function rather than attempting to measure it; \nand correcting for inflow by adding flow-related enhancement in the \nsignal model.\n\nThe solutions are illustrated for the use case of MR renography in a \nminipig with unilateral kidney fibrosis. The data are taken from \nB\u00f8gh et al (2024).\n\n## Reference\nNikolaj B\u00f8gh, Lotte B Bertelsen, \nCamilla W Rasmussen, Sabrina K Bech, Anna K Keller, Mia G Madsen, \nFrederik Harving, Thomas H Thorsen, Ida K Mieritz, Esben Ss Hansen, \nAlkwin Wanders, Christoffer Laustsen.
