        "\n# An exploration of water exchange effects\n\nThis tutorial will explore the effect of water exchange in a standard \ntwo-compartmental tissue using the models in `dcmri.Tissue`.\n\nThe three tissue compartments involved are the blood, interstitium and tissue \ncells. The water exchange effects refer to the transport of water across the \nbarriers between them: **transendothelial** water exchange between blood and \ninterstitium, and **transcytolemmal** water exchange between interstitium and \ntissue cells. The water exchange in the blood compartment between plasma and \nred blood cells is assumed to be in the fast exchange limit. \n\nWater exchange across either of these two barriers can be in the \nfast-exchange limit (F), restricted (R), or there may be no water exchange at \nall (N). Since there are two barriers involved this leads to 3x3=9 possible \nwater exchange regimes. `dcmri.Tissue` denotes these 9 regimes by a \ncombination of the letters F, R and N: the frst letter refers to the water \nexchange across the endothelium, and the second to the water exchange across \nthe cell wall. For instance, 'FR' means fast water exchange (F) across the \nendothelium, and restricted water exchange (R) across the cell wall.\n\nFor regimes with restricted water exchange, the rate of exchange is quantified \nby the permeability-surface area (PS) of water, a quantity in units \nof mL/sec/cm3. `dcmri.Tissue` uses the notation ``PSe`` for the \ntransendothelial water PS and ``PSc`` for the transcytolemmal PS.\n"
