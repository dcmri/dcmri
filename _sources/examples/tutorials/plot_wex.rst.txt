========================================
An exploration of water exchange effects
========================================

This tutorial will explore the effect of water exchange in a standard 
two-compartmental tissue using the models in `dcmri.Tissue`.

The three tissue compartments involved are the blood, interstitium and tissue 
cells. The water exchange effects refer to the transport of water across the 
barriers between them: **transendothelial** water exchange between blood and 
interstitium, and **transcytolemmal** water exchange between interstitium and 
tissue cells. The water exchange in the blood compartment between plasma and 
red blood cells is assumed to be in the fast exchange limit. 

Water exchange across either of these two barriers can be in the 
fast-exchange limit (F), restricted (R), or there may be no water exchange at 
all (N). Since there are two barriers involved this leads to 3x3=9 possible 
water exchange regimes. `dcmri.Tissue` denotes these 9 regimes by a 
combination of the letters F, R and N: the frst letter refers to the water 
exchange across the endothelium, and the second to the water exchange across 
the cell wall. For instance, 'FR' means fast water exchange (F) across the 
endothelium, and restricted water exchange (R) across the cell wall.

For regimes with restricted water exchange, the rate of exchange is quantified 
by the permeability-surface area (PS) of water, a quantity in units 
of mL/sec/cm3. `dcmri.Tissue` uses the notation ``PSe`` for the 
transendothelial water PS and ``PSc`` for the transcytolemmal PS.

We set up the simulation by importing the necessary packages and defining 
the constants that will be fixed throughout.

The role of water exchange
----------------------------
To show how water exchange is relevant in DC-MRI analysis, it is insightful 
to first consider the extreme ends of the water exchange spectrum in some 
more detail: fast water exchange (F) and no water exchange (N). 

Let's first generate a tissue without water exchange across either barrier. 
We will use the more general model of restricted water exchange 'RR' and set 
the permeabilities to zero, as this then also plots the signals in individual 
compartments:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 63-67

.. code-block:: Python


    tissue_nn = dc.Tissue('2CX', 'RR', PSe=0, PSc=0, **aif)
    tissue_nn.plot()

In this model the indicator and water occupy the same compartments, so the 
concentrations on the right are the same. The magnetization (bottom left) 
follows the profile of the indicator concentrations exactly: since 
magnetization cannot 
exchange, it cannot equilibrate and remains directly proportional to the 
concentration in the compartment. Notably, the magnetization in the tissue 
cells remains constant as no indicator can enter this 
compartment to modify it, and no magnetization can be transferred.

Now lets consider the opposite scenario of fast water exchange across both 
barriers (*Note*: we could use the FF model here, but for the purposes of 
this illustration it is more instructive to use RR with very high values 
for the water permeabilities): 

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 81-85

The indicator concentration in the tissue compartments is not affected by 
the level of water exchange (top and bottom right), but the magnetization 
in all 3 compartments is now effectively the same (bottom left). Even the 
tissue cells, 
which receive no indicator at all, show the same signal changes over time 
as the interstitium and blood compartments. This is because, with very high 
levels of water exchange, the magnetization between all 3 compartments mixes 
so rapidly that any differences are levelled out instantly. The tissue is 
well-mixed for water (and therefore water magnetization), although it is not 
well-mixed for indicator.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 98-101

Now let's consider the cases where one of the barriers is highly permeable 
for water, and the other is impermeable. First let's look at the case of 
high transendothelial water exchange and no transcytolemmal water exchange:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 101-105

.. code-block:: Python


    tissue_fn = dc.Tissue('2CX','RR', PSe=1e3, PSc=0, **aif)

   :class: sphx-glr-single-img





.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 106-109

As expected, blood and interstitium have the same magnetization throughout 
and the magnetization of tissue cells is not altered at all. The opposite 
case is similar:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 109-113

.. code-block:: Python


    tissue_nf = dc.Tissue('2CX','RR', PSe=0, PSc=1e3, **aif)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 114-116

In this case the tissue cells recieve the same magnetization as the 
interstitium.

Water exchange effect on the MR signal
--------------------------------------

From a measurement perspective, the important question is to what extent 
water exchange across either barrier affects the measured signal, shown in 
the top left corner of the plots above. 

To illustrate the signal differences in more detail, we plot signals in 
mixed exchange regimes against the extremes of fast and no exchange. For 
reference we also include a tissue with intermediate water exchange: 

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 129-163

.. code-block:: Python


    # Build a tissue in an intermediate water exchange regime
    tissue_rr = dc.Tissue('2CX','RR', PSe=1, PSc=2, **aif)

    # Generate signals in all regimes
    signal_ff = tissue_ff.signal()
    signal_nn = tissue_nn.signal()
    signal_fn = tissue_fn.signal()
    signal_nf = tissue_nf.signal()
    signal_rr = tissue_rr.signal()

These figures show clearly that water exchange levels have a measureable 
effect on signals, and at all times lie between the extremes of no water 
exchange (blue) and fast water exchange (green). 

However, while the effect of water exchange is detectable, it is 
comparatively small considering the difference between the blue and green 
curves represent the extremes. By contrast, changing the exchange rate of 
the indicator between its extremes of no- and infinite indicator exchange 
has a more significant impact on the signal:

Water exchange bias
-------------------
As shown above, water exchange is to some extent a second order effect 
compared to indicator exchange. Nevertheless, making inaccurate assumptions 
regarding the level of water exchange can lead to large biases in the other 
measured parameters.

One way to explore the scale of this water exchange bias is by training a 
tissue that has no water exchange (NN) using data generated by a tissue in 
fast water exchange:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 203-209

.. code-block:: Python


    # Train a NN tissue on the fast-exchange signal and plot results
    tissue_nn = dc.Tissue('2CX', 'NN', **aif)
    tissue_nn.train(t, signal_ff)
    tissue_nn.plot(t, signal_ff)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 210-213

The plot shows that the no-exchange tissue predicts the data with high 
accuracy. However, the reconstructed magnetization is incorrect for fast 
exchange tissue, and the reconstructed parameters are severely biased:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 213-221

.. code-block:: Python


    truth = tissue_ff.params('vp','vi','Ktrans')
    rec = tissue_nn.params('vp','vi','Ktrans')

    print('vi error:', round(100*(rec[1]-truth[1])/truth[1],1), '%')
    print('Ktrans error:', round(100*(rec[2]-truth[2])/truth[2],1), '%')

Removing water exchange bias
----------------------------
Water exchange forms a dangerous source of measurement error because it 
cannot be detected by comparing the fit to the data. In ideal circumstances, 
it can be removed by generalizing the model to allow for any level of water 
exchange. Let's try this and look at the results again:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 228-234

.. code-block:: Python


    # Train an RR tissue and plot again
    tissue = dc.Tissue('2CX','RR', **aif)
    tissue.train(t, signal_ff, xtol=1e-3)
    tissue.plot(t, signal_ff)

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 235-238

Plotting the results now show a practically perfect fit to the data, and the 
magnetization is close to the fast exchange limit. Also the measurements of 
the kinetic parameters are more accurate:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 238-244

.. code-block:: Python


    rec = tissue.params('vp','vi','Ktrans')
    print('vp error:', round(100*(rec[0]-truth[0])/truth[0],1), '%')
    print('vi error:', round(100*(rec[1]-truth[1])/-truth[1],1), '%')
    print('Ktrans error:', round(100*(rec[2]-truth[2])/truth[2],1), '%')





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

    vp error: 1.0 %
    vi error: -0.8 %
    Ktrans error: 0.7 %




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 245-249

As a bonus the water-exchange sensitive model also estimates the water 
permeability. While a numerical fit will not produce the accurate result of 
infinite water PS, this nevertheless produces values that correspond to 
extremely high levels of water exchange: 

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 249-254

    rec = tissue.params('PSe', 'PSc', round_to=0)
    print('PSe:', rec[0], 'mL/sec/cm3')
    print('PSc:', rec[1], 'mL/sec/cm3')

    PSe: 115.0 mL/sec/cm3
    PSc: 126.0 mL/sec/cm3

Handling water exchange
-----------------------
The above example suggests one strategy of removing water exchange bias, 
i.e. include water exchange rates as free parameters and get the added 
benefit of a water exchange measurement. However this may not always be the 
right approach. The data in this tutorial are noise-free, and therefore even 
very subtle structure can be exploited to estimate parameters. In noisy data 
this may not be the case, and one may well be forced to fix parameters that 
have a relatively small effect on the data in order to improve the precision 
in others. 

This raises the question where any of the regimes of fast and zero water 
exchange offers a good approximation to real tissues. For this exercise we 
will assume values on the upper end of literature data. We plot the 
resulting signal against the extremes of fast and no exchange:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 270-289

.. code-block:: Python


    # Generate tissue
    tissue = dc.Tissue('2CX', 'RR', PSe=0.05, PSc=1.5, **aif)
    tissue_nn = dc.Tissue('2CX', 'NN', **aif)
    tissue_ff = dc.Tissue('2CX', 'FF', **aif)

    # Plot signals 
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(6,5))

    ax.set_title('Restricted water exchange against extremes')
    ax.plot(t, tissue_ff.signal(), 'g-', label='Fast water exchange')
    ax.plot(t, tissue_nn.signal(), 'b-', label='No water exchange')
    ax.plot(t, tissue.signal(), 'r--', label='Restricted water exchange')
    ax.set_xlabel('Time (sec)')
    ax.set_ylabel('Signal (a.u.)')
    ax.legend()

    plt.show()

   :class: sphx-glr-single-img





.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 290-299

With these settings, the restricated water exchange signal is approximately 
intermediate between fast and no water exchange. Hence neither approximation 
appears particulare more accurate than the alternative. 

However, the impact 
of water exchange also depends on the imaging sequence, such as the choice 
of flip angle. Hence these effects should be taken into account when 
optimizing the scan protocol. Water exchange sensitivity should be maximized 
for studies that aim to measure it, and minimized for studies where it is a 
confounder.
