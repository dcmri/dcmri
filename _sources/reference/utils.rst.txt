.. currentmodule:: dcmri

A collection of helper functions that may be useful for testing code, 
building examples, or to construct new models.

.. _convolution-functions:

Convolution
===========

Convolution is an essential mathematical tool for solving linear and 
stationary compartment models. Explicit numerical convolution is slow, and 
`dcmri` includes apart from a generic convolution method also some faster and 
more accurate functions for use in special cases where one or both of the 
factors have a known form.
