dcmri 0.6.17
============

This version moves all data examples over to the 
`dmr format <https://openmiblab.github.io/pydmr/>`_, replacing 
the previous usage of .pkl files which are not human readable. 
Guidance for contributors has been updated accordingly.

Additionally, documentation structure has changed slightly removing 
the 'generated' folder which created lengthy URL's.
