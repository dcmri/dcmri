dcmri 0.6.9
===========

We're happy to announce the release of dcmri 0.6.9!

.. warning::

    This version comes with some API changes mainly in the user interfaces 
    for liver and exchange tissues. As the package is still in development, 
    these are not explicitly listed or announced. Please consult the 
    examples and function-level documentation for detail on the current 
    API.


Main features
-------------

- Significantly extended the documentation pages including 
  also sections with basics and mathematical details of the modelling.

- Significantly extended the models that are available through the user 
  interfaces, now covering for instance all water exchange regimes for 
  vascular-interstitial tissues, as well as dual-inlet and single inlet models 
  for the liver.

- The user interfaces for data analysis on all tissue types (except kidney) 
  have been harmonized with a common interface and documentation structure. 

Also in this version: moved the repository over to a dedicated github 
organization and deployed the documentation on 
`dcmri.org <https://dcmri.org/>`_.
